# colourBlindr
Colo(u)rBlindr is an app that allows normal color vision types to perceive the world as colour blind types do, allowing them to understand the challenges that colour blind individuals face.
# How it works
The app implements existing algorithms which uses an array of matrix values to apply a red-green shift to images based on the 'confusion line' of the colour blindness profile. Red-green colour blindness is the most common form of colour blindness and typically affects men more than women. Most of the time this is a result of a cone deficiency, which makes it difficult for one to distinguish between different colors at various hues.
